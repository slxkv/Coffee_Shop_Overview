# Coffee_Shop_Overview

# Project Background

The Sales & Marketing Department faces challenges in optimizing sales and marketing efforts due to a lack of visibility into the performance of product categories across two stores.

Without insights into daily and hourly sales patterns, the department struggles to make data-driven decisions about inventory management, resource allocation, and promotional strategies, potentially leading to missed revenue opportunities and inefficiencies.

### **Key pain point?**
- Lack of targeted marketing: Without clear pattern, marketing efforts are often broad and less effective.
- Staff shortage: Difficulty in making the right shift schedule for staff, resulting in slower services especially during peak hour/day
  
### **Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**

- **Promotional Analysis:** Identify top-selling products and optimal times for promotions.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** measureable metrics can drive performance and help the coffee shop achieve its goals.
- **Peak Hour Identification and Dynamic Scheduling:** to avoid staff schedule conflicts.
